# Noita review 10/10

Noita is absolutely horrible, bad, no good game! The amount of bugs, glitches and unintended behaviors is staggering all while completely ignored by the devs for years! No proper saves system, tiny and cluttered inventory, huge amount of wrong info on tooltips, oh did i mention that performance optimization is the gameâ€™s weakest pont bringing even the fastest pc to their knees?! I would not be playing this game even i have been payed to do so, -1/10 do not recommend frown
